# Armstrong-Numbers
Python code which checks if a given number is an Armstrong Number or not.

<p>
  Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of cubes of its digits.<br>
  example: 407 = 4<sup>3</sup> + 0<sup>3</sup> + 7<sup>3</sup> = 64 + 0 + 343 = 407. 
  Hence, it is an Armstrong Number.<br>
  example: 123 = 1<sup>3</sup> + 2<sup>3</sup> + 3<sup>3</sup> = 1 + 8 + 27 = 36 != 123. 
  Hence, it is not an Armstrong Number.<br>
